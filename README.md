# TriTone

TriTone is an sample player with 3D animations.
It was built with Three.js, Tone.js, Tween.js and React.

Users can press the A-Z keys on their keyboard to trigger sounds and visuals.

This kind of allows you to make an interactive music video depending on the sequence on keys you press.
